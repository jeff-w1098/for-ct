old stuff, maybe someone can make use of it


created these long ago during uni mostly when the main thing ppl did in crypto was trade derivs throughout 2018 2019


no longer rly use these things anymore, just some things found might be handy



am mediocre coder, throwing things into notebooks so it's ez to pick apart

limit order ting notebook just lets u scale limit orders at a range around price, distributes orders in norm curve

queue trades subscribes to mex ws endpoint and reports to u if a trade was an open or close
